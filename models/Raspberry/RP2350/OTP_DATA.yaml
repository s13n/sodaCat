      CHIPID0..3 rows contain a 64-bit random identifier for this chip, which can
      be read from the USB bootloader PICOBOOT interface or from the get_sys_info
      ROM API.\n\n                    The number of random bits makes the occurrence
      of twins exceedingly unlikely: for example, a fleet of a hundred million devices
      has a 99.97% probability of no twinned IDs. This is estimated to be lower than
      the occurrence of process errors in the assignment of sequential random IDs,
      and for practical purposes CHIPID may be treated as unique."
