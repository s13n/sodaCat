      of this register.\n\n                    - If a single debug key has been registered,
      and no matching key value has been supplied over SWD, then all debug features
      are disabled. This can be fully overridden by setting all bits of this register.\n\

      and the Secure key's value (key 5) has been supplied over SWD, then no debug
      features are disabled by the key mechanism. However, note that in this case
      debug features may still be disabled by the critical boot flags."
