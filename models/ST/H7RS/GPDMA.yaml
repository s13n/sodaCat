The first memory burst read of a (possibly 2D/repeated) block, also named as the first ready FIFO-based source burst, is gated by the occurrence of both the hardware request and the first trigger hit.\nThe GPDMA monitoring of a trigger for channel x is started when the channel is enabled/loaded with a new active trigger configuration: rising or falling edge on a selected trigger (TRIGPOL[1:0] = 01 or respectively TRIGPOL[1:0] = 10).\nThe monitoring of this trigger is kept active during the triggered and uncompleted (data or link) transfer; and if a new trigger is detected then, this hit is internally memorized to grant the next transfer, as long as the defined rising or falling edge is not modified, and the TRIGSEL[5:0] is not modified, and the channel is enabled.\nTransferring a next LLI<sub>n+1</sub> that updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0], resets the monitoring, trashing the memorized hit of the formerly defined LLI<sub>n </sub>trigger.\nAfter a first new trigger hit<sub>n+1</sub> is memorized, if another second trigger hit<sub>n+2</sub> is detected and if the hit<sub>n</sub> triggered transfer is still not completed, hit<sub>n+2 </sub>is lost and not memorized.memorized.
