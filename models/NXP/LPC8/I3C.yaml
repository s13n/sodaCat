            description: CONTROLLER_ON. Controller is enabled. When used upon start-up, this I3C module is the Main Controller by default. The module controls the bus unless the controller ishanded off. If the controller is handed off, then MSTENA must become 2, so that it has the capability to become the controller again. Performing the handoff means emittingGETACCMST CCC command. If the command is accepted, the module emits a STOP and sets the MSTENA field to 2 (or 0).
