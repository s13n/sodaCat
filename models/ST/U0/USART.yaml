The MSB of the character sent by the transmitter should be equal to 1. In 4-bit address mark detection, only ADD[3:0] bits are used.\nIn low-power mode: they are used for wake up from low-power mode on character match.\nWhen WUS[1:0] is programmed to 0b00 (WUF active on address match), the wake-up from low-power mode is performed when the received character corresponds to the character programmed through ADD[6:0] or ADD[3:0] bitfield (depending on ADDM7 bit), and WUF interrupt is enabled by setting WUFIE bit. The MSB of the character sent by transmitter should be equal to 1.\nIn Run mode with Mute mode inactive (for example, end-of-block detection in ModBus protocol): the whole received character (8 bits) is compared to ADD[7:0] value and CMF flag is set on match. An interrupt is generated if the CMIE bit is set.\nThese bits can only be written when the reception is disabled (RE1=10) or when the USART is disabled (UE1=10)."
