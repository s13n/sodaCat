      of the PLL3 VCO.\nThe software must set correctly these bits to insure that
      the VCO output frequency is between its valid frequency range, that is:\n* 128
      to 560 MHz if PLL3VCOSEL = 0\n* 150 to 420 MHz if PLL3VCOSEL = 1\nVCO output
      frequency = Fref3_ck x (PLL3N + (PLL3FRACN / 213)), with\n* \tPLL3N between
      8 and 420\n* \tPLL3FRACN can be between 0 and 213- 1\n* \tThe input frequency
      Fref3_ck must be between 1 and 16 MHz.\nTo change the PLL3FRACN value on-the-fly
      even if the PLL is enabled, the application must proceed as follows:\n* \tSet
      the bit PLL3FRACEN to 0\n* \tWrite the new fractional value into PLL3FRACN\n\
      * \tSet the bit PLL3FRACEN to 1."
