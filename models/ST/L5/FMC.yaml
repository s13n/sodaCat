        description: "Bus turnaround phase duration These bits\n              are written by software to add a delay at the end of\n              a write transaction to match the minimum time between\n              consecutive transactions (tEHEL from ENx high to ENx\n              low): (BUSTRUN + 1) KCK_FMC period &#8805;\n              tEHELmin. The programmed bus turnaround delay is\n              inserted between a an asynchronous write transfer and\n              any other asynchronous /synchronous read or write\n              transfer to or from a static bank. If a read\n              operation is performed, the bank can be the same or a\n              different one, whereas it must be different in case\n              of write operation to the bank, except in muxed mode\n              or mode D. In some cases, whatever the programmed\n              BUSTRUN values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as\n              follows: The bus turnaround delay is not inserted\n              between two consecutive asynchronous write transfers\n              to the same static memory bank except for muxed mode\n              and mode D. There is a bus turnaround delay of 2 FMC\n              clock cycle between: Two consecutive synchronous\n              write operations (in Burst or Single mode) to the\n              same bank A synchronous write transfer ((in Burst or\n              Single mode) and an asynchronous write or read\n              transfer to or from static memory bank. There is a\n              bus turnaround delay of 3 FMC clock cycle between:\n              Two consecutive synchronous write operations (in\n              Burst or Single mode) to different static banks.
