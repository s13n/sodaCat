registers:
  - name: CR
    description: D/A Converter Register. This register contains the digital value to be converted to analog and a power control bit.
    addressOffset: 0

    access: read-write
    resetValue: 0
    resetMask: 131008
    fields:
      - name: VALUE
        description: After the selected settling time after this field is written with a new VALUE, the voltage on the DAC_OUT pin (with respect to VSSA) is VALUE (VREFP - VREFN)/1024 + VREFN.

        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: '0'
            description: The settling time of the DAC is 1 us max, and the maximum current is 700 uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 1 MHz.
            value: 0
          - name: '1'
            description: The settling time of the DAC is 2.5 us and the maximum current is 350 uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 400 kHz.

            value: 0
          - name: '1'
            description: When this bit and the CNT_ENA bit are both set, the double-buffering feature in the DACR register will be enabled. Writes to the DACR register are written to a pre-buffer and then transferred to the DACR on the next time-out of the counter.
            value: 1
