          cease executing instructions, except those written directly to 
          SMx_INSTR by the system. Multiple bits can be set/cleared at once to 
          run/halt multiple state machines simultaneously.

      - name: CLKDIV_RESTART
        description: "Restart a state machine's clock divider from an initial phase
          of 0. Clock dividers are free-running, so once started, their output (including
          fractional jitter) is completely determined by the integer/fractional divisor
          configured in SMx_CLKDIV. This means that, if multiple clock dividers with
          the same divisor are restarted simultaneously, by writing multiple 1 bits
          to this field, the execution clocks of those state machines will run in
          precise lockstep.\n\n                            Note that setting/clearing
          SM_ENABLE does not stop the clock divider from running, so once multiple
          state machines' clocks are synchronised, it is safe to disable/reenable
          a state machine, whilst keeping the clock dividers in sync.\n\n        \
          \                    Note also that CLKDIV_RESTART can be written to whilst
          the state machine is running, and this is useful to resynchronise clock
          dividers after the divisors (SMx_CLKDIV) have been changed on-the-fly."

          to 4. Note that the value of PINCTRL_SIDESET_COUNT is inclusive of 
          this enable bit.
