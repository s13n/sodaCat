    description: SIR low-power IrDA mode. This bit selects the IrDA encoding mode.
      If this bit is cleared to 0, low-level bits are transmitted as an active high
      pulse with a width of 3 / 16th of the bit period. If this bit is set to 1, low-level
      bits are transmitted with a pulse width that is 3 times the period of the IrLPBaud16
      input signal, regardless of the selected bit rate. Setting this bit uses less
      power, but might reduce transmission distances.

    description: Loopback enable. If this bit is set to 1 and the SIREN bit is set
      to 1 and the SIRTEST bit in the Test Control Register, UARTTCR is set to 1,
      then the nSIROUT path is inverted, and fed through to the SIRIN path. The SIRTEST
      bit in the test register must be set to 1 to override the normal half-duplex
      SIR operation. This must be the requirement for accessing the test registers
      during normal operation, and SIRTEST must be cleared to 0 when loopback testing
      is finished. This feature reduces the amount of external coupling required during
      system test. If this bit is set to 1, and the SIRTEST bit is set to 0, the UARTTXD
      path is fed through to the UARTRXD path. In either SIR mode or UART mode, when
      this bit is set, the modem outputs are also fed through to the modem inputs.
      This bit is cleared to 0 on reset, to disable loopback.

    description: Framing error. When set to 1, it indicates that the received character
      did not have a valid stop bit (a valid stop bit is 1). This bit is cleared to
      0 by a write to UARTECR. In FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character
      at the top of the FIFO.

    description: Parity error. When set to 1, it indicates that the parity of the

      in the Line Control Register, UARTLCR_H. This bit is cleared to 0 by a write
      to UARTECR. In FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the
      top of the FIFO.

    description: Break error. This bit is set to 1 if a break condition was detected,
      indicating that the received data input was held LOW for longer than a full-word
      transmission time (defined as start, data, parity, and stop bits). This bit
      is cleared to 0 after a write to UARTECR. In FIFO mode, this error is associated
      with the character at the top of the FIFO. When a break occurs, only one 0 character
      is loaded into the FIFO. The next character is only enabled after the receive
      data input goes to a 1 (marking state) and the next valid start bit is received.

    description: Overrun error. This bit is set to 1 if data is received and the FIFO
      is already full. This bit is cleared to 0 by a write to UARTECR. The FIFO contents
      remain valid because no more data is written when the FIFO is full, only the
      contents of the shift register are overwritten. The CPU must now read the data,
      to empty the FIFO.
