            description: Sampled System Clock Mode. The system clock clocks the SCT module, but the counter and prescalers are only enabled to count when the designated edge is detected on the input selected by the CKSEL field. The minimum pulse width on the selected clock-gate input is 1 bus clock period. This mode is the high-performance, sampled-clock mode.

The input/edge selected by the CKSEL field clocks the SCT module, including the counters and prescalers, after first being synchronized to the system clock. The minimum pulse width on the clock input is 1 bus clock period. This mode is the low-power, sampled-clock mode.

The input clock rate must be at least half the system clock rate and can be the same or faster than the system clock.

If an input is known to already be synchronous to the SCT clock, this bit may be set to 0 for faster input response. (Note: The SCT clock is the system clock for CKMODEs 0-2. It is the selected, asynchronous SCT input clock for CKMODE3). Note that the INSYNC field only affects inputs used for event generation.
