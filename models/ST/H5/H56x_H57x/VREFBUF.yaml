    description: "Trimming code\nThe TRIM code is a 6-bit unsigned data (minimum 000000,

      Reset:\nTRIM[5:0] is automatically initialized with the VRS = 0 trimming value
      stored in the Flash memory during the production test.\nVRS change:\nTRIM[5:0]
      is automatically initialized with the trimming value (corresponding to VRS setting)
      stored in the Flash memory during the production test.\nWrite in TRIM[5:0]:\n\
      User can modify the TRIM[5:0] with an arbitrary value. This is permanently disabling
      the control of the trimming value with VRS (until the device is reset).\nNote:
      If the user application performs the trimming, the trimming code must start
      from 000000 to 111111 in ascending order."
