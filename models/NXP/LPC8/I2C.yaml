      - name: SLVPENDING
        description: Slave Pending. Indicates that the Slave function is waiting to
          continue communication on the I2C-bus and needs software service. This flag
          will cause an interrupt when set if enabled via INTENSET. The SLVPENDING
          flag is not set when the DMA is handling an event (if the SLVDMA bit in
          the SLVCTL register is set). The SLVPENDING flag is read-only and is automatically
          cleared when a 1 is written to the SLVCONTINUE bit in the SLVCTL register.
          The point in time when SlvPending is set depends on whether the I2C interface
          is in HSCAPABLE mode. See Section 25.7.2.2.2. When the I2C interface is
          configured to be HSCAPABLE, HS master codes are detected automatically.
          Due to the requirements of the HS I2C specification, slave addresses must
          also be detected automatically, since the address must be acknowledged before
          the clock can be stretched.
