# sodaCat tasks

This folder contains task descriptions suitable to throw at AI agents. But of
course you can also follow them manually.

The aim is to come up with a model with the least amount of effort, using data
material from manufacturers that is not well suited for automatic data mining.
In the worst case this will be datasheets and reference manuals, where data
needs to be scraped from tables and diagrams.

This will invariably be an iterative process where you guide the AI agent to
providing either a model directly, or helping you write a parser for generating
the model.

Don't hesitate to improve the tasks here, as the AI agents also evolve quickly.
Adding new tasks is also welcome. This is all rather experimental at this time.
