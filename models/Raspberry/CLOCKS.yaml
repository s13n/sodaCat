    description: The glitchless multiplexer does not switch instantaneously (to avoid
      glitches), so software should poll this register to wait for the switch to complete.
      This register contains one decoded bit for each of the clock sources enumerated
      in the CTRL SRC field. At most one of these bits will be set at any time, indicating
      that clock is currently present at the output of the glitchless mux. Whilst
      switching is in progress, this register may briefly show all-0s.
