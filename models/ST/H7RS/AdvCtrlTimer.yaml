Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below).\n...\nExample: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 bytes & DBA = TIM2_CR1.\nIf DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIM2_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation:\n(TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL\nIn this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data are copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA\nAccording to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur:\nIf the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data are transferred to each of the 7 registers.\nIf the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data are also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA."
