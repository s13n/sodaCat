        description: ETM power down. This bit can be used by an implementation to control if the ETM is in a low power state. This bit must be cleared by the trace software tools at the beginning of a debug session. When this bit is set to 1, writes to some registers and fields might be ignored.

        description: Stall processor. The FIFOFULL output can be used to stall the processor to prevent overflow. The FIFOFULL output is only enabled when the stall processor bit is set to 1. When the bit is 0 the FIFOFULL output remains LOW at all times and the FIFO overflows if there are too many trace packets. Trace resumes without corruption once the FIFO has drained, if overflow does occur. An ETM reset sets this bit to 0.

        description: Branch output. When set to 1 all branch addresses are output, even if the branch was because of a direct branch instruction. Setting this bit enables reconstruction of the program flow without having access to the memory image of the code being executed. When this bit is set to 1, more trace data is generated, and this may affect the performance of the trace system. Information about the execution of a branch is traced regardless of the state of this bit. An ETM reset sets this bit to 0.
