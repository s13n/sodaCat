        description: "HSE remapping enable/disable\nWhen cleared, the bit remaps the HSE clock source from PF0-OSC_IN/PF1-OSC_OUT pins to PC14-OSCX_IN/PC15-OSCX_OUT. Thus PC14-OSCX_IN/PC15-OSCX_OUT are shared by both LSE and HSE and the two clock sources cannot be use simultaneously.\nOn packages with less than 48 pins, the remapping is always enabled (PF0-OSC_IN/PF1-OSC_OUT are not available), regardless of this bit. As all STM32C011xx packages have less than 48 pins, this bit is only applicable to STM32C031xx.\nNote: On 48 pins packages, when HSE_NOT_REMAPPED is reset, HSE cannot be used in bypass mode. Refer to product errata sheet for more details."
