Hardware toggles this bit, when the ACK handshake is sent following a data packet reception having a matching data PID value; if the endpoint is defined as a control one, hardware clears this bit at the reception of a SETUP PID received from host (in device mode), while it sets this bit to 1 when SETUP transaction is acknowledged by device (in host mode).\nIf the endpoint/channel is using the double-buffering feature this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping too (Refer to  less than xe1 [Double-buffered_endpoints_and_usage_in_Device_mode]/>).\nIf the endpoint/channel is isochronous, this bit is used only to support packet buffer swapping for data transmission since no data toggling is used for this kind of channels/endpoints and only DATA0 packet are transmitted (Refer to  less than xe2 [Isochronous_transfers_in_Device_mode]/>). Hardware toggles this bit just after the end of data packet reception, since no handshake is used for isochronous transfers.\nThis bit can also be toggled by the software to initialize its value (mandatory when the endpoint is not a control one) or to force specific data toggle/packet buffer usage.
