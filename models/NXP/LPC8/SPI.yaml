      - name: RXOV
        description: Receiver Overrun interrupt flag. This flag applies only to slave
          mode (Master = 0). This flag is set when the beginning of a received character
          is detected while the receiver buffer is still in use. If this occurs, the
          receiver buffer contents are preserved, and the incoming data is lost. Data
          received by the SPI should be considered undefined if RxOv is set.

          new data on the next input clock if the transmitter is idle. If that data
          is not available in the transmitter holding register at that point, there
          is no data to transmit and the TXUR flag is set. Data transmitted by the

      - name: SSA
        description: Slave Select Assert. This flag is set whenever any slave select
          transitions from deasserted to asserted, in both master and slave modes.
          This allows determining when the SPI transmit/receive functions become busy,
          and allows waking up the device from reduced power modes when a slave mode
          access begins. This flag is cleared by software.

        description: End Transfer control bit. Software can set this bit to force
          an end to the current transfer when the transmitter finishes any activity
          already in progress, as if the EOT flag had been set prior to the last transmission.
          This capability is included to support cases where it is not known when
          transmit data is written that it will be the end of a transfer. The bit
          is cleared when the transmitter becomes idle as the transfer comes to an
          end. Forcing an end of transfer in this manner causes any specified FRAME_DELAY
          and TRANSFER_DELAY to be inserted.
