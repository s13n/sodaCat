      instructions, except those written directly to SMx_INSTR by the system. Multiple

    description: "Restart a state machine's clock divider from an initial phase of\
      \ 0. Clock dividers are free-running, so once started, their output (including\
      \ fractional jitter) is completely determined by the integer/fractional divisor\
      \ configured in SMx_CLKDIV. This means that, if multiple clock dividers with\
      \ the same divisor are restarted simultaneously, by writing multiple 1 bits\
      \ to this field, the execution clocks of those state machines will run in precise\
      \ lockstep.\n\n                            Note that setting/clearing SM_ENABLE\
      \ does not stop the clock divider from running, so once multiple state machines'\
      \ clocks are synchronised, it is safe to disable/reenable a state machine, whilst\
      \ keeping the clock dividers in sync.\n\n                            Note also\
      \ that CLKDIV_RESTART can be written to whilst the state machine is running,\
      \ and this is useful to resynchronise clock dividers after the divisors (SMx_CLKDIV)\
      \ have been changed on-the-fly."
