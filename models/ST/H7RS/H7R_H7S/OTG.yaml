There is only one setup packet per buffer. On receiving a setup packet, the OTG_HS closes the buffer and disables the corresponding endpoint after SETUP_COMPLETE status is seen in the Rx FIFO. OTG_HS puts a SETUP_COMPLETE status into the Rx FIFO when it sees the first IN or OUT token after the SETUP packet for that particular endpoint. The application must then re-enable the endpoint to receive any OUT data for the control transfer and reprogram the buffer start address. Because of the above behavior, OTG_HS can receive any number of back to back setup packets and one buffer for every setup packet is used."
