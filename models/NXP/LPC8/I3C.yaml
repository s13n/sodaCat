              off, then MSTENA must move to 2 after that happens. The handoff means
              emitting GETACCMST and if accepted, the module will emit a STOP and
              set the MSTENA bit to 2 (or 0).'

              master mode. To switch to master mode, the slave emits an Master Request
              (MR), or gets a GETACCMST CCC command and accepts it (to switch on the
