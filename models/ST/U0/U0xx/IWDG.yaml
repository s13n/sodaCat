        description: "Key value (write only, read 0x0000)\nThese bits can be used for several functions, depending upon the value written by the application:\n- 0xAAAA: reloads the RL[11:0] value into the IWDCNT down-counter (watchdog refresh), and write-protects registers. This value must be written by software at regular intervals, otherwise the watchdog generates a reset when the counter reaches 0.\n- 0x5555: enables write-accesses to the registers.\n- 0xCCCC: enables the watchdog (except if the hardware watchdog option is selected) and write-protects registers.\n- values different from 0x5555: write-protects registers.\nNote that only IWDG_PR, IWDG_RLR, IWDG_EWCR and IWDG_WINR registers have a write-protection mechanism."
