      from that master. LOCK is writable only by a Secure, Privileged processor or
      debugger.\n\n                    LOCK bits are only writable when their value
      is zero. Once set, they can never be cleared, except by a full reset of ACCESSCTRL\n\
      \n                    Setting the LOCK bit does not affect whether an access
      raises a bus error. Unprivileged writes, or writes from the DMA, will continue
      to raise bus errors. All other accesses will continue not to."
