          be less than or equal to 72 MHz. Typically, software should program the
          smallest value in this field that yields this maximum clock rate or slightly
          less, but in certain cases (such as a high-impedance analog source) a slower
          clock may be desirable. This field is ignored in the asynchronous operating

          an enabled out-of-range or threshold-crossing event on any channel). Each
          type of threshold comparison interrupt on each channel must be individually
          enabled in the INTEN register to cause this interrupt. This bit will be
          cleared when all of the individual threshold flags are cleared via writing
          1s to those bits.

        description: Overrun Interrupt flag. Any overrun bit in any of the individual
          channel data registers will cause this interrupt. In addition, if the MODE
          bit in either of the SEQn_CTRL registers is 0 then the OVERRUN bit in the
          corresponding SEQn_GDAT register will also cause this interrupt. This interrupt
          must be enabled in the INTEN register. This bit will be cleared when all
          of the individual overrun bits have been cleared via reading the corresponding
          data registers.
