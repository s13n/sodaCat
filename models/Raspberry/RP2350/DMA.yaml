          \                           Program the number of bus transfers a channel
          will perform before halting. Note that, if transfers are larger than one
          byte in size, this is not equal to the number of bytes transferred (see
          CTRL_DATA_SIZE).\n\n                            When the channel is active,
          reading this register shows the number of transfers remaining, updating
          automatically each time a write transfer completes.\n\n                \
          \            Writing this register sets the RELOAD value for the transfer
          counter. Each time this channel is triggered, the RELOAD value is copied
          into the live transfer counter. The channel can be started multiple times,
          and will perform the same number of transfers each time, as programmed by
          most recent write.\n\n                            The RELOAD value can be
          observed at CHx_DBG_TCR. If TRANS_COUNT is used as a trigger, the written
          value is used immediately as the length of the new transfer sequence, as
          well as being written to RELOAD."

          \                           Program the number of bus transfers a channel
          will perform before halting. Note that, if transfers are larger than one
          byte in size, this is not equal to the number of bytes transferred (see
          CTRL_DATA_SIZE).\n\n                            When the channel is active,
          reading this register shows the number of transfers remaining, updating
          automatically each time a write transfer completes.\n\n                \
          \            Writing this register sets the RELOAD value for the transfer
          counter. Each time this channel is triggered, the RELOAD value is copied
          into the live transfer counter. The channel can be started multiple times,
          and will perform the same number of transfers each time, as programmed by
          most recent write.\n\n                            The RELOAD value can be
          observed at CHx_DBG_TCR. If TRANS_COUNT is used as a trigger, the written
          value is used immediately as the length of the new transfer sequence, as
          well as being written to RELOAD."
