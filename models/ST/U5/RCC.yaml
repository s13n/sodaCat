It can be written at any time, allowing dynamic fine-tuning of the PLL3 VCO.\nVCO output frequency = F<sub>ref3_ck</sub> x (PLL3N + (PLL3FRACN / 2<sup>13</sup>)), with: \nPLL3N must be between 4 and 512.\nPLL3FRACN can be between 0 and 2<sup>13 </sup>- 1.\nThe input frequency F<sub>ref3_ck</sub> must be between 4 and 16 MHz.\nIn order to change the FRACN value on-the-fly even if the PLL is enabled, the application must proceed as follows:\nSet the bit PLL3FRACEN to 0. \nWrite the new fractional value into PLL3FRACN. \nSet the bit PLL3FRACEN to 1."
