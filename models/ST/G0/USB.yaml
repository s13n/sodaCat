When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list.

When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction.\nVALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled.\n- NAK\nNAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received.

When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it is regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated.\n-\tVALID\nA host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction.\nVALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled.\n- NAK\nNAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE\n- STALL\nSTALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received.

Therefore, the hardware cannot change the status of the channel/endpoint/channel after a successful transaction. If the software sets the STATTX bits to 'STALL' or 'NAK' for an isochronous channel/endpoint, the USB peripheral behavior is not defined.

Refer to  for the full descriptions ('Host mode' descriptions). Whereas in Device mode, these bits contain the status that are given out on the following transaction, in Host mode they capture the status last received from the device. If a NAK is received, STATTX contains the value indicating NAK."

In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list.

When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction.\nVALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel.

Hardware sets the STATRX bits to NAK when a correct transfer has occurred (VTRX=1) corresponding to a OUT or SETUP (control only) transaction addressed to this endpoint, so the software has the time to elaborate the received data before it acknowledges a new transaction.\nDouble-buffered bulk endpoints implement a special transaction flow control, which control the status based upon buffer availability condition (Refer to endpoints and usage in Device mode).\nIf the endpoint is defined as isochronous, its status can be only 'VALID' or 'DISABLED', so that the hardware cannot change the status of the endpoint after a successful transaction.

These bits are read/write but they can be only toggled by writing 1.\nHost mode\nThese bits are the host application controls to start, retry, or abort host transactions driven by the channel.\nThese bits also contain information about the device answer to the last IN channel transaction and report the current status of the channel according to the following STATRX table of states:\n-\tDISABLE\nDISABLE value is reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a single-buffer channel. When in DISABLE state the channel is unused or not active waiting for application to restart it by writing VALID. Application can reset a VALID channel to DISABLE to abort a transaction. In this case the transaction is immediately removed from the host execution list. If the aborted transaction was already under execution it is regularly terminated on the USB but the relative VTRX interrupt is not generated.\n-\tVALID\nA host channel is actively trying to submit USB transaction to device only when in VALID state.VALID state can be set by software or automatically by hardware on a NAKED channel at the start of a new frame. When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction.\nVALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel. In this case the channel remains active on the alternate buffer while application needs to read the current buffer and toggle DTOGTX. In case software is late in reading and the alternate buffer is not ready, the host channel is automatically suspended transparently to the application. The suspended double buffered channel is re-activated as soon as delay is recovered and DTOGTX is toggled.\n- NAK\nNAK value is reported in case of NAK acknowledge received. When in NAK state the channel is suspended and does not try to transmit. NAK state is moved to VALID by hardware at the start of the next frame, or software can change it to immediately retry transmission by writing it to VALID, or can disable it and abort the transaction by writing DISABLE\n- STALL\nSTALL value is reported in case of STALL acknowledge received. When in STALL state the channel behaves as disabled. Application should not retry transmission but reset the USB and re-enumerate."

When set to VALID, an host channel enters the host execution queue and waits permission from the host frame scheduler to submit its configured transaction.\nVALID value is also reported in case of ACK acknowledge is received on a double-buffered channel.

A bit stuffing error was detected anywhere in the PID, data, and/or CRC.\nFVIO:\tFraming format violation. A non-standard frame was received (EOP not in the right place, wrong token sequence, etc.).\nThe USB software can usually ignore errors, since the USB peripheral and the PC host manage retransmission in case of errors in a fully transparent way. This interrupt can be useful during the software development phase, or to monitor the quality of transmission over the USB bus, to flag possible problems to the user (for example loose connector, too noisy environment, broken conductor in the USB cable and so on). This bit is read/write but only 0 can be written and writing 1 has no effect."

        description: "Packet memory area over / underrun\nThis bit is set if the microcontroller has not been able to respond in time to an USB memory request. The USB peripheral handles this event in the following way: During reception an ACK handshake packet is not sent, during transmission a bit-stuff error is forced on the transmitted stream; in both cases the host retries the transaction. The PMAOVR interrupt should never occur during normal operations. Since the failed transaction is retried by the host, the application software has the chance to speed-up device operations during this interrupt handling, to be ready for the next transaction retry; however this does not happen during isochronous transfers (no isochronous transaction is anyway retried) leading to a loss of data in this case. This bit is read/write but only 0 can be written and writing 1 has no effect."
