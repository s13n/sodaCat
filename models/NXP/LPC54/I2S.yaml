This could be done in order to change streams, or while restarting after a data underflow or overflow. When paused, FIFO operations can be done without corrupting data that is in the process of being sent or received. Once a data pause has been requested, the interface may need to complete sending data that was in progress before interrupting the flow of data. Software must check that the pause is actually in effect before taking action. This is done by monitoring the DATAPAUSED flag in the STAT register. When DATAPAUSE is cleared, data transfer will resume at the beginning of the next frame.

When ONECHANNEL = 1, the single channel of data may be placed on the right by setting POSITION to 0x100 + the data position within the right side (e.g. 0x108 would place data starting at the 8th clock after the middle of the frame).
