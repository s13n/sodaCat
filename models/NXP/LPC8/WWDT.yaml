registers:
  - name: MOD
    description: Watchdog mode register. This register contains the basic mode and
      status of the Watchdog Timer.
    addressOffset: 0
    size: 32
    access: read-write
    resetValue: 0
    resetMask: 63
    fields:
      - name: WDEN
        description: Watchdog enable bit. Once this bit is set to one and a watchdog
          feed is performed, the watchdog timer will run permanently.
        bitOffset: 0
        bitWidth: 1
        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: STOP
            description: Stop. The watchdog timer is stopped.
            value: 0
          - name: RUN
            description: Run. The watchdog timer is running.
            value: 1
      - name: WDRESET
        description: Watchdog reset enable bit. Once this bit has been written with
          a 1 it cannot be re-written with a 0.
        bitOffset: 1
        bitWidth: 1
        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: INTERRUPT
            description: Interrupt. A watchdog time-out will not cause a chip reset.
            value: 0
          - name: RESET
            description: Reset. A watchdog time-out will cause a chip reset.
            value: 1
      - name: WDTOF
        description: Watchdog time-out flag. Set when the watchdog timer times out,
          by a feed error, or by events associated with WDPROTECT. Cleared by software
          writing a 0 to this bit position. Causes a chip reset if WDRESET = 1.
        bitOffset: 2
        bitWidth: 1
        access: read-write
      - name: WDINT
        description: Warning interrupt flag. Set when the timer is at or below the
          value in WDWARNINT. Cleared by software writing a 1 to this bit position.
          Note that this bit cannot be cleared while the WARNINT value is equal to
          the value of the TV register. This can occur if the value of WARNINT is
          0 and the WDRESET bit is 0 when TV decrements to 0.
        bitOffset: 3
        bitWidth: 1
        access: read-write
      - name: WDPROTECT
        description: Watchdog update mode. This bit can be set once by software and
          is only cleared by a reset.

        bitWidth: 1
        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:

            description: Flexible. The watchdog time-out value (TC) can be changed
              at any time.
            value: 0
          - name: THRESHOLD
            description: Threshold. The watchdog time-out value (TC) can be changed
              only after the counter is below the value of WDWARNINT and WDWINDOW.
            value: 1
      - name: LOCK
        description: Once this bit is set to one and a watchdog feed is performed,
          disabling or powering down the watchdog oscillator is prevented by hardware.
          This bit can be set once by software and is only cleared by any reset.
