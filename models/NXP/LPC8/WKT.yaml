          only has an effect if the SEL_EXTCLK bit is not set.'

        enumeratedValues:
          - name: DIVIDED_FRO_CLOCK
            description: 'Divided FRO clock. This clock runs at 750 kHz and provides
              time-out periods of up to approximately 95 minutes in 1.33 us increments.
              Remark: This clock is not available in not available in Deep-sleep,
              power-down, deep power-down modes. Do not select this option if the
              timer is to be used to wake up from one of these modes.'
            value: 0
          - name: LOW_POWER_CLOCK
            description: 'This is the (nominally) 10 kHz clock and provides time-out
              periods of up to approximately 119 hours in 100 us increments. The accuracy
              of this clock is limited to +/- 40 % over temperature and processing.
              Remark: This clock is available in all power modes. Prior to use, the
              low-power oscillator must be enabled. The oscillator must also be set
              to remain active in Deep power-down if needed.'

        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: NO_TIME_OUT
            description: No time-out. The self wake-up timer has not timed out. Writing
              a 0 to has no effect.
            value: 0
          - name: TIME_OUT
            description: Time-out. The self wake-up timer has timed out. This flag
              generates an interrupt request which can wake up the part from any reduced
              power mode including Deep power-down if the clock source is the low
              power oscillator. Writing a 1 clears this status bit.
            value: 1

        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: NO_EFFECT
            description: No effect. Reading this bit always returns 0.
            value: 0
          - name: CLEAR_THE_COUNTER
            description: Clear the counter. Counting is halted until a new count value
              is loaded.
            value: 1
      - name: SEL_EXTCLK
        description: Select external or internal clock source for the self wake-up
          timer. The internal clock source is selected by the CLKSEL bit in this register
          if SET_EXTCLK is set to internal.
        bitOffset: 3

        access: read-write
        enumeratedValues:
          - name: INTERNAL
            description: Internal. The clock source is the internal clock selected
              by the CLKSEL bit.
            value: 0
          - name: EXTERNAL
            description: External. The self wake-up timer uses the external WKTCLKIN
              pin.
            value: 1

    fields:
      - name: VALUE
        description: A write to this register pre-loads start count value into the
          timer and starts the count-down sequence. A read reflects the current value
          of the timer.
