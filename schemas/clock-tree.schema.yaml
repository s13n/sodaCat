        The divider factor can either be fixed, in which case it is given by the value property,
        or it can be an integer factor from a register field, or it can be a fractional value
        given by two register fields, one for the numerator (factor) and one for the denominator.

        When both register(s) and value are given, the value is an offset to be applied after
        forming the integer or fractional value from the register fields.

        If none is given, the divider doesn't divide (i.e. factor is 1)

      the register can be found. How the register can be addressed and
      accessed is specified elsewhere.
