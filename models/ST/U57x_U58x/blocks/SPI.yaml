    description: "master automatic suspension in Receive mode\nThis bit is set and
      cleared by software to control continuous SPI transfer in master receiver mode
      and automatic management in order to avoid overrun condition.\nWhen SPI communication
      is suspended by hardware automatically, it could happen that few bits of next
      frame are already clocked out due to internal synchronization delay.\nThis is
      why, the automatic suspension is not quite reliable when size of data drops
      below 8 bits. In this case, a safe suspension can be achieved by combination
      with delay inserted between data frames applied when MIDI parameter keeps a
      non zero value; sum of data size and the interleaved SPI cycles should always
      produce interval at length of 8 SPI clock periods at minimum. After software
      clearing of the SUSP bit, the communication resumes and continues by subsequent
      bits transaction without any next constraint. Prior the SUSP bit is cleared,
      the user must release the RxFIFO space as much as possible by reading out all
      the data packets available at RxFIFO based on the RXP flag indication to prevent
      any subsequent suspension."

    description: "CRC register for transmitter\nWhen CRC calculation is enabled, the
      TXCRC[31:0] bits contain the computed CRC value of the subsequently transmitted
      bytes. CRC calculation is initialized when the CRCEN bit of SPI_CR1 is written
      to 1 or when a data block is transacted completely. The CRC is calculated serially
      using the polynomial programmed in the SPI_CRCPOLY register.\nThe number of
      bits considered at calculation depends on SPI_CRCPOLY register and CRCSIZE bits
      settings at SPI_CFG1 register.\nNote: a read to this register when the communication
      is ongoing could return an incorrect value.\nNote: TXCRC[31-16] bits are reserved
      at instances with data size limited to 16-bit. There is no constrain when 32-bit
      access is applied at these addresses. Reserved bits 31-16 are always read zero

      field is not taken into account when the content of this register is read by
