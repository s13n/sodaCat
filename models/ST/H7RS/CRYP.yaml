When key is coming from the SAES peripheral (KMOD[1:0] = 0x2), write is also ignored. With KMOD[1:0] at 0x0, a special writing sequence is required. In this sequence, any valid write to CRYP_KxR/LR register clears the KEYVALID flag except for the sequence-completing write that sets it. Also refer to the description of the KEYVALID flag in the CRYP_SR register."
