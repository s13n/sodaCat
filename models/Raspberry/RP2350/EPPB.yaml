    description: NMI mask for IRQs 0 through 31. This register is core-local, 
      and is reset by a processor warm reset.

  - name: SLEEPCTRL
    addressOffset: 8
    description: Nonstandard sleep control register
    resetValue: 2
    fields:
      - name: LIGHT_SLEEP
        description: "By default, any processor sleep will deassert the system-level
          clock request. Reenabling the clocks incurs 5 cycles of additional latency
          on wakeup.\n\n                            Setting LIGHT_SLEEP to 1 keeps
          the clock request asserted during a normal sleep (Arm SCR.SLEEPDEEP = 0),
          for faster wakeup. Processor deep sleep (Arm SCR.SLEEPDEEP = 1) is not affected,
          and will always deassert the system-level clock request."
        access: read-write
        bitOffset: 0
        bitWidth: 1
      - name: WICENREQ
        description: Request that the next processor deep sleep is a WIC sleep. 
          After setting this bit, before sleeping, poll WICENACK to ensure the 
          processor interrupt controller has acknowledged the change.
        access: read-write
        bitOffset: 1
        bitWidth: 1
      - name: WICENACK
        description: Status signal from the processor's interrupt controller. 
          Changes to WICENREQ are eventually reflected in WICENACK.
